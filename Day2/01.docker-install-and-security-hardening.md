## 🐳 Docker Installation & Security Hardening Guide

This guide walks you through installing Docker on Ubuntu, running a security benchmark scan, and configuring audit rules to harden the Docker engine.

---

### 📦 Step 1: Install Docker

Create an installation script:

```bash
sudo -i
vim docker-install.sh
````

Paste the following content:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update packages and install dependencies
sudo apt-get update -y 
sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl -y 

# Add Docker’s GPG key
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc

# Add Docker repository
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] \
https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
$(. /etc/os-release && echo "${UBUNTU_CODENAME:-$VERSION_CODENAME}") stable" | \
sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null

# Install Docker packages
sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin -y
```

Run the installation:

```bash
sh docker-install.sh
```

Enable and start Docker:

```bash
systemctl start docker
systemctl enable docker
```

---

### 🔐 Step 2: Run Docker Security Benchmark

1. Search for **Docker Bench Security** in your browser or go directly to the official repo:
   👉 [https://github.com/docker/docker-bench-security](https://github.com/docker/docker-bench-security)

2. Clone and run the tool:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/docker/docker-bench-security.git
cd docker-bench-security
sudo sh docker-bench-security.sh
```

> You will see a detailed security score and list of failed checks.

---

### 📋 Step 3: Enable Auditd for Monitoring

Install and enable audit daemon:

```bash
sudo apt install auditd -y
sudo systemctl start auditd
sudo systemctl enable auditd
```

View current audit rules:

```bash
auditctl -l
```

Edit audit rules to monitor Docker-related directories:

```bash
cd /etc/audit/rules.d
sudo vim audit.rules
```

Add the following lines to `audit.rules` (based on Docker Bench Security output):

```bash
-w /var/lib/docker -p rwa -k DOCKER
-w /etc/docker -p rwxa -k DOCKER
```

---

### 🔁 Step 4: Re-run Docker Bench & Verify Fixes

After making changes, re-run the security scan:

```bash
cd docker-bench-security
sudo sh docker-bench-security.sh
```

You should see an improved score and fewer vulnerabilities.

---

### ✅ Summary

By following this guide, you've:

* Installed Docker securely
* Audited and fixed security gaps
* Hardened your system using Docker Bench and Auditd

Keep iterating until your Docker engine reaches a healthy security baseline (ideally 80–90%+ score). 🔐
